### What is Jenkins? ###

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to            
building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) installed.

Jenkins is free and is entirely written in Java. Jenkins is a widely used application around the world. By using Jenkins,
software companies can accelerate their software development process, as Jenkins can automate build and test at a rapid rate.
Jenkins supports the complete development lifecycle of software from building, testing, documenting the software, deploying
and other stages of a software development lifecycle.
