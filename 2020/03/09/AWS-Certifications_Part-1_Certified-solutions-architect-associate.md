### A word on AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner ###

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner is AWS's newest certification. This entry-level certification is designed to validate a candidate's overall understanding of the AWS cloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS Certification Category   |	AWS Certification Name				    |	AWS Certification Cost
Developing		     | 	AWS Certified Developer � Associate		    |	$150
Operations		     |	AWS Certified SysOps Administrator � Associate	    |	$150
Architecting		     |	AWS Certified Solutions Architect � Professional    |	$300
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most common approach to begin your cloud career is to start with AWS Solution Architect Associate Certification. Solutions Architect AWS Certification is a great way to familiarize yourself with AWS ecosystem and core AWS services. Moreover, it is mandatory to have an associate certificate before you can take the AWS Solutions Architect Professional Certification.

### What Order Should the AWS Certification Exams be taken? ###

I have found the following sequence to be the most impactful route for entry into the AWS certs and turbocharging a cloud career:

- The Associate Certificates

  * AWS Certified Solutions Architect�associate
  * AWS Certified Developer�associate
  * AWS Certified SysOps Administrator�associate

- The Speciality/Professional Certificates

  * AWS Certified DevOps Engineer�professional
  * AWS Certified Solutions Architect�professional

Note that this route does not include the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, as it�s not a terribly technical exam and essentially just covers a basic understanding of the AWS platform. I recommend folks in technical roles to start with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect�associate exam and move on from there.
